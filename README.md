# Heart_disease_prediction
This project aims to predict whether a patient is at the risk of Heart disease using various features like age, sex, physical activity etc.

The jupyter notebook 'heard_disease_pred.ipynb' import , analyses and trains a logistic regression model on the given 'heart.csv' dataset.

The notebook also consists of various visualizations for analysing both the dataset and the ML model.

At the end you can find a code cell that takes input from user and aims to predict whether the patient is at the risk of heart disease.

You can pick any one value from the 'heart.csv' file and give it as input to the code cell present in the jupyter notebook.

The accuracy of the model is between 83% and 85%.
